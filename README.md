### How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?

The deep neural network for my model has 40 neurons in the first layer and 25 neurons in the second layer. There are two hidden layers, both have activation as relu and the output layer is set to sigmoid. I chose this model because it can analyze data vigourously while keeping in mind that the model does not result in overfitting. 

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

I was not able to achieve the target model performance. I tried to increase the epoch number, I used different numbers of hidden layers and higher number of neurons in each hidden layer. 

### If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?

I would choose Random Forest model. This model is less likely to result in overfitting compared to neural network models.
